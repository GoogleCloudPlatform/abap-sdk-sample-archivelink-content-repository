## Pre-requisites

This solution is built on top of [ABAP SDK for Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/abap-sdk/on-premises-or-any-cloud/whats-new). Therefore your SAP system should have the latest version of the SDK (Version 1.7 or later) installed to proceed ahead. All the required configuration for the SDK to connect to Google Cloud APIs should be set-up following the SDK’s [authentication guide](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/abap-sdk/on-premises-or-any-cloud/latest/authentication).

On your Google Cloud project enable the Google Cloud storage API and set up a bucket with nearline storage.

**Note** : The Service Account that you have configured in the Client Key configuration should have the IAM roles Storage Object Creator `roles/storage.objectCreator` and Storage Admin `roles/storage.admin`

## Steps to setup Archive Link for Cloud Storage

**Step 1:** Follow the [Release Instructions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/abap-sdk-sample-archivelink-content-repository/releases) to import the solution into your SAP system.

**Step 2:** Create a background user (user id: ARCHIVEUSER)  to invoke the SICF HTTP Handler class during runtime.

**Step 3:** Create SICF Node for ArchiveLink

## Archive To BigQuery

The new [BigQuery Toolkit for SAP](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/abap-sdk/on-premises-or-any-cloud/latest/bq-toolkit-for-sap-overview) lets you archive SAP table data directly into BigQuery. Query archived data using familiar SE16/N-like functionality within [BigQuery Studio](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-overview#bigquery-studio) and [Looker](https://cloud.google.com/looker), and leverage [BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bqml-introduction) to unlock powerful insights.

### How to configure and Archive to BigQuery

1. Install and configure the latest (V1.9 or above) version of [ABAP SDK for Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/abap-sdk/on-premises-or-any-cloud/latest/install-config)
2. Configure [BigQuery Toolkit for SAP](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/abap-sdk/on-premises-or-any-cloud/latest/bq-toolkit-for-sap-configuration). Make a note of Data Transfer Key configured in Tcode /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS
3. Configure entries in table ZGOOG_ARCH_BQ using SM30
   | Column                                 | Value         |
   | ------------------------------------   | ------------- |
   | Archiving Object                       | Name of the archiving object for which the data should be replicated to BigQuery |
   | Data Transfer Key                      | BigQuery Data Transfer Key from Tcode /GOOG/BQTR_SETTINGS |
   | Is Setting Active Flag                 | Enabling this write archive data to BigQuery |
4. When you run the [Archive Delete Program](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nw73ehp1/7.31.19/en-US/4d/8c788a910b154ee10000000a42189e/frameset.htm), the implementation ZGOOG_BADI_ARC_WRITE_TO_BQ of BADI definition ARC_DEL_FINISHED will automatically send the archive data to BigQuery. 
5. Alternatively, you can also use program ZGOOG_R_BQ_WRITE_ARCHIVE_DATA to manually select and write archive data to BigQuery. 

Note - BADI ARC_DEL_FINISHED is only available in systems with SAP_BASIS component 740 and above. Refer to note [3063034](https://me.sap.com/notes/3063034/E) for more details. If your system is not compatible, you can exclude the implementation ZGOOG_BADI_ARC_WRITE_TO_BQ when importing.
